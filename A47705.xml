            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving been converſant above three and thirty years with the poor, whom to aſſiſt has been my employ; I find a docile ſpirit amongſt them: and that many of them are hungry, as I may term it, and eager after Inſtructions, not ſo much in curioſity, as to be informed of their duty. But, I fear, this of holy Jeremy is too much verified in theſe days. <hi>The little ones have asked bread, and there was none that brake it to them.</hi> Lament. c. 4. v. 4. Not but that there are many excellent Sermons made, many pious and learned Books writ: but that men of this age being grown ſo curious, and of itching ears after eloquence of ſpeech, quaint and refined language in Proſe, Poëticall fancies, and conceits, in Verſe: that where theſe are not found, the Sermon, or Book, takes not, let the ſubject be never ſo pious: which makes moſt Preachers, and Writers, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to dreſs up, what they render, in ſuch ſort that it may be gratefull to thoſe who eſteem themſelves the Wits of the Age. And perhaps all the profit they reap from them, is this Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium: The man ſpoke well; he has writ good language, and is full of witty conceits: and in the mean time, thoſe who ſeek more after the virtue, than the curioſity of the word, are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their deſires: the language, or conceits, ſo exceeding their capacities, that they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:57296:3"/>unto the ſenſe: and ſo make little or no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this as condemning ſuch Preachers, or writers: for certainly, when Piety, Learning, Wit, and Eloquence, are joyned together, that is the moſt compleat Work. But I rather make an Apology for theſe plain Verſes, which I dedicate unto the Poor, who indeed ſtand moſt in need of Inſtructions, which muſt be given to them in an humble and low ſtile, befitting their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Wherefore, I hope, no pious perſon will carp at them, which are beneath a Poets cenſure: ſince I pretend not to Poetry in them: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have put ſuch Inſtructions, as I think needful to the Poor People, in Meeter, fitted for tunes: ſuch manner of reading being moſt delightfull to young People, ſooner learn't, and better retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which they may learn to ſing, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the great abuſe that is now a days among many, in ſinging profane and laſcivious ſongs. And I doubt not but ſome will ſay, that theſe exceed the length of ſongs. I grant it: but ſince I make them for Inſtructions, commonly the ſubject I treat of, (conſidering the capacities they are fitted to) cannot be fully explicated in shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to their advantage. And they may ſerve the good man to ſing working at his trade; thereby to edify his family. Receive then, you little ones of Chriſt's flock, and my dearly beloved, theſe my ſmall endeavours for you, and make that uſe of them which I hoped for, when I made them:
<pb facs="tcp:57296:4"/>that knowing what is evill, you may avoid it: and what is good you may embrace, and put it into practice: that ſo Chriſt's coming may not be in vain to you: who came not only to redeem you from ſin, but alſo to teach you Virtue. And if this Book may happily advantage you in this, (as I hope it will) I have what I aimed at and as I ever had a love for, and deſire to ſerve you, ſo I hope you will be mindfull, in your prayers, of</p>
